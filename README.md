## GamhubWebSite was one of my first Websites I have done using Basics of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.
### It is a simple Front-end Website with just 3 windows :
#### 1/ Home page :
  > Which is presenting a Discord Server with  different pictures using "Carousel" done by **JavaScript**
#### 2/About us page : 
  > In which we can find all GameHub's Staff and members + a little discord window in it which shows in real time who's in the discord rooms and how many players are connected.
#### 3/Events page :
  > Which lists all the events done by GameHub and it's winners.
#### 4/Links :
  > We can find a discord link in the Header and an instagram page in the Footer of the page.
